- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ozzy-P
- 👀 I’m interested in hopefully not destroying my computer
  * One is one too many, even if it wasn't intentional.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to avoid the above.
  * Not guaranteed to not happen.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that does not make #2 happen.
- 📫 How to reach me?
  * Find one.
  * Or, you know, here.
